<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_full.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

# Include some data examples in your package

<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below
-->


# Functions to generate color palettes

## Extract hex-code of colors specified in a tibble

```{r examples-get_color_hex_code}
datafile <- system.file("mycolors.csv", 
                        package = "stadlColorPaletteR")
mycolors <- readr::read_csv(datafile)
get_color_hex_code('palevioletred2', base_colors = mycolors)

```

## Generate colors for later interpolation

```{r examples-generate_colors_to_interpolate}
datafile <- system.file("mycolors.csv", 
                        package = "stadlColorPaletteR")
mycolors <- readr::read_csv(datafile)

# combinations with 2 colors
generate_colors_to_interpolate(mycolors, 2)

#combinations with all colors
generate_colors_to_interpolate(mycolors, nrow(mycolors))

```

# Calculate the mean of a vector

<!--
There can be other functions, examples and tests in your flat template.
Each of them will be inflated in a different file, provided that there is a level-1 or level-2 section title to separate from previous functions.
-->


## Use sub-functions in the same chunk

```{r examples-my_other_median}
my_other_median(1:12)
```

<!--

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->


# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
